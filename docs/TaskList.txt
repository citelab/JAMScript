Get basic REXEC working:
    = C to JS working
    = JS to C working
======================

We need to use self-stabilizing algorithms for bringing
up the connection table in the server side. 
How can we infer the state of the connection table?

======================

Interesting problem: Do we need consensus algorithms like Paxos or
RAFT? What is their purpose to implement reliable stores for data?

Can we think of a distributed ledger for quick updates?




= Checkout the self stabilizing algorithms?
= Can we make it self stabilizing?
    = What is self stabilization here??

= What about residual sockets in the networks
= Ports openned by other apps or left behind this program?


= PING/PONG is the heartbeat of the system

= Disconnect and reconnect of the devices

= Get REXEC working:

= Call from Device to J-core
= Call from J-core to single device, multiple devices, etc

= Check fault tolerance...

= We need to store state at the server side too! This is another headache!
