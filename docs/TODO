= Test J->C Async
= DONE Test C->J Sync                
= Test C->J Async
= Develop J->C Sync... get it working..

J->C Sync:
    = 




May 14th
========

= Debug J->C - Asychronous execution
= Get the C->J Asynchronous execution working..

= Get J->C sychronous working.. need to code the generators, etc.



May 12th
========

DONE    Duplicate elimination on C side for publish..

DONE    Process the publish from J->C Async: take care of the
        callback handlers;

        NOTE: There is nothing to implement in the runtime. We need to
        use the C->J (Sync) to deploy the callbacks. Since they are working we
        are good to go.
        
= C->J Async
    Send the request (command). Callback encoded as a string.
    On the J side decode the string as a callback. We need to store the
    decoding information.
    
= Figure out the J->C Sync method using generators and yielding.

= Segfault on error from J-core on C->J invocations

= Do error checking and see if all possibilities are covered...

=======

C side. Design and Implmement a Task runner.
= Check the incoming message. Is the task (func) available for running? If not, generate an error.
= Check parameters. If parameters don't match, generate an error.
= Send a RDY message and wait. 
= If the RDY message is not received before expiry, then cancel offer.

= Once the STA message is received, start the execution.


NEXT
====
Split into Sync and Async.



   

Start the cloud side of things too..
    = Play with zookeeper





April 29th

Fix jam_rexec_runner()

Get REXEC reply from the j-core.
It should be routed to the c-core.

Get the full protocol working.

Multiple executions working for C->J side.

Nested executions?




April 14th
==========

Delete stuff from the configuration key-value store.
We need to remove Fog servers and cloud servers that are not responsive.
