/* 
 * Design Thought on dFlow:
 * Multiple readers and single writer. The dFlow is organized into rows that keep moving as they are written (
 * same as uFlow). The rows are driven by jamclock of the writer (in this case the controller). In dFlow the 
 * rows are continuously moving with the writes. So, even if there are no readers picking up the data, the rows 
 * would keep moving. However, the dFlow length (buffered data is something we can configure) ensures that previous 
 * data is available. Each reader has its own read pointer in the stream so it gets continuous data as it keeps reading 
 * irrespective of how other readers are progressing with the stream. The progress (movement of the rows) is solely 
 * dependent on the writer. 
 * 
 * Problem: How do we handle the following situation? We have dFlow with lot of data. However, it is not currently written.
 * Do we want new readers to consume all the old data? 
 * 
 * Rule: an inactive dFlow can have totally outdated data. So, we don't deal with it. Once data arrives, there will be 
 * signalling for that data and would bring the readers. Each reader would see how much data is there in the flow and start processing 
 * all the data - starting from whatever each reader hasn't seen. So, the reader is going to get the older data as well. However,
 * with an active flow, the data is not going to be that old. 
 * 
 * NOTE: We can define dFlow reads or properties in two different ways: read from the tail (newest data) or head (oldest data)
