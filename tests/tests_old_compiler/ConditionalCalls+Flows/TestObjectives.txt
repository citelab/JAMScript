In these tests we want to test the following mechanisms.

We have remote calls and uflows or dflows or both.
The tasks are controlled by JCond expressions.

JCond at the controller
    = called by the worker
    == jt30.* 

JCond at the controller
    = called by the worker
    = called by the controller
    == jt31.* 

Repeat the above with tasks with return results
    = * Failing now..
    == jt32.*


Repeat the above with some tasks that return results and others don't return results
    == jt33.*


JCond at the worker 
    = called by the local worker 
    = called by remote controllers from the device, fog levels
    == jt34.*

JCond at both sides 
    = called by all sides 
    == most complex test 
    == jt35.*
