 * The task executor runs tasks from the respective ready queues. Based on the provided
 * argument, this function determines whether it is a primary or secondary executor thread.
 *
 * If primary executor (pExecutor), this is the "main thread" of the tBoard. This executor
 * handles the primary queues. Essential tasks (tasks that have dependancies/deadlines) are
 * run by this executor. If there are no tasks pending in the primary ready queue, or if
 * there are tasks before earliest start time (EST), then pExecutor may run tasks from a
 * secondary ready queue, returning them to their original queue on task_yield(). Should
 * pExecutor not find a task to run, it will sleep on the primary condition variable
 * tBoard->pCond (no_work).
 *
 * If secondary executor (sExecutor), then tasks will be pulled only from respective
 * secondary ready queue. If there are no tasks in queue, sExecutor will sleep on
 * respective condition variable tBoard->sCond[i].
 *
 * Pulling tasks from ready queues has two phases:
 * * spin-block phase: (not implemented)
 * * *    to save overhead from frequent sleeping/waking on condition variables, executor
 * * *    will poll the ready queue for a preset number of iterations before entering the

 *
 * * sleep-wake phase:
 * * *    after spin-block phase, executor will sleep on condition variable defined above.
 * * *    Condition variable will signal when a task is added into respective ready queue.
 *
 * Task executors will run as described indefinitely until task board is instructed to
 * terminate via special function tboard_kill().
 *
 * Context: Function will run in it's own thread, created in tboard_start().
 * Context: Function will sleep on condition variables described above
 * Context: Function will lock mutexes corresponding to tboard queues that it accesses
 * Context: Function will call history.c functions, locking tboard->hmutex

 * until task function yields or terminates. Poorly construction functions will prevent multi-tasking.
 *
 * Tasks can be executed for a finite amount of time, or iterations can run indefinitely. For the latter,
 * tasks will typically be run in an infinite loop and are expected to yield after every iteration, otherwise
 * the single task will run the entire time, blocking other tasks from executing.
