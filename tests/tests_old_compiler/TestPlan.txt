Tests planned
=============
* Prediction cache
    Objective: Test the PC in the controller side.
    Setup: One controller and many workers (20 or so). The workers are pushing the C2J calls to the controller with 
    the same parameters. Task at the controller is compute heavy (medium). So, it spins at the controller for some time. 
    
    Expected results: With PC turned on, we need to see better throughput. More tasks completed in shorter times.

* Fog hoisting testing
    Objective: Show that force fog switching is working.
    Setup: Have some fogs and devices under them. Run a forceFogHoist() on the devices that would convert all devices to fogs.
    Continuously log the status of the devices and see whether all of them turned into fogs.

    Expected results: See whether all devices are turning into fogs and then back to devices.

* Conditional calls (Turn off A)
    Objective: Partial test - examine whether some of the nodes can turn themselves off using JCond - A
    Setup: Have 3-5 fogs. Use a tag value to turn off some of the Fogs. Call the fogs from the devices.

    Expected results: We need to get results from the fogs that are not turned off. The fogs that are turned off should not
    contribute to the results. If all the fogs are turned off, we should get a jerror set at the worker.

* Conditional calls (Turn off B)
    Objective: Partial test - examine whether some of the nodes can turn themselves off using JCond - B
    Setup: Have 3-5 workers. Use a tag value to turn off some of the workers. Call the workers from the device-level or fog-level controller.

    Expected results: We need to get results from the devices that are not turned off. The devices that are turned off should not
    contribute to the results. If all the devices are turned off, we should get an empty set at the controller (no error).

    NOTE: Put the above in the language spec - expected behaviour.


Tests completed
===============
* All remote call tests are completed. Tested without JCond or UDFlows. 

Tests in progress
=================
June 9, 2023
    JCond tests are in progress
        C2J has problems with synchronous J sides that are disabled using JCond
        The C side is hanging expecting a return value that is not coming.
        We need to return with an error code (set using jerror).
