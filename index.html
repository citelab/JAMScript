<blockquote>Important Announcement:</blockquote>

<p>
Cloud computing is the backbone that is currently powering
all forms of mobile, web, and social computing systems.
The emerging cyber-physical applications such as smart cities and
autonomous vehicles are bringing new requirements that are making
cloud computing less than optimal as the computing mainstay.

Mobile IoT, edge/fog computing, cloud computing, fast wireless and wired networks
are some of the key building blocks of future cyber-physical systems such as
smart cities, smart transportation systems, and smart energy.

<p>
<a href="https://www.ge.com/digital/blog/what-edge-computing">Edge computing</a> (used
interchangeably with fog computing in this site)
and <a href="https://www.gsma.com/iot/mobile-iot-introduction/">mobile IoT</a>
are poised to play pivotal roles along with cloud computing in future cyber-physical computing applications
such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and smart energy.
While edge computing brings enormous potential to improve the overall
performance of such systems, it also complicates application development and deployment. In
particular, applications need to leverage both the fog for short-term needs and
clouds for long-term needs such as long-term data storage. Another important
problem  is disconnection and fault tolerance. Cloud computing concentrates the
resources at the  datacenters whereas fog computing disperses the resources
throughout the network. Therefore, new fog specific approaches are needed for disconnection and fault  tolerance.
The diagram below illustrates an example cloud-fog-device deployment.

<p>JAMScript is a <B>systems programming language</B> and middleware designed for a
three-tiered system of clouds, fogs, and devices. It is a polyglot language
that combines C and JavaScript. A proof-of-concept compiler and runtime for different
<I>*nix</I> operating systems are provided in this repository. As part of ongoing research,
we are carrying out many different
experiments and prototyping interesting applications (e.g, distributed shells, parking spot managers) using
JAMScript. An emulator using Docker containers has been developed to
quickly launch and test various distributed system configurations with JAMScript code loaded in them.
It is highly suitable for running various prototyping experiments involving clouds, fogs, and devices.
