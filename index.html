title: JAMScript
subtitle: A Language and Middleware for Cloud of Moving Things
---

<p>Cloud computing is the backend of choice for many Internet of Things (IoT)
applications that create high rate data streams. Despite its widespread
acceptance, cloud computing has its share of drawbacks: high and variable access
latency, global computing context, and data privacy concerns. Fog computing
(known by different names such as Cloudlets, edge computing) is proposed as a
way of addressing some of these concerns. In fog computing, resources are
distributed closer to the edge so that client devices can access data and
services with high reliability and low access latency.

<p>While fog computing brings enormous potential to improve the overall
performance, it also complicates the application development and deployment. In
particular, applications need to leverage both the fog for short-term needs and
clouds for long-term needs such as long-term data storage. Another important
problem  is disconnection and fault tolerance. Cloud computing concentrates the
resources at the  datacenters whereas fog computing disperses the resources
throughout the network. Therefore, the disconnection and fault  tolerance approaches
developed for cloud computing are not suitable for fogs.

<p>JAMScript is a <I>systems programming language</I> and middleware designed for a
three-tiered system of clouds, fogs, and devices. It is a polyglot language
that combines C and JavaScript. A proof-of-concept compiler and runtime for different
<I>*nix</I> operating systems are provided in this repository. We are carrying out many different
experiments and prototyping interesting applications (e.g, distributed shells, parking spot managers) using
JAMScript. An emulator using Docker containers has been developed to
quickly launch and test various distributed system configurations with JAMScript code loaded in them.
It is highly suitable for running various prototyping experiments involving clouds, fogs, and devices.
